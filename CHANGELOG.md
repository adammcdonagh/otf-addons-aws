# Changelog

## v24.38.0

- Use boto3 s3 client copy (instead of copy_object) when moving/renaming for post copy actions, to allow handling of large files
- Fix file watch test after text adjustment

## v24.36.1

- Adjust tests for SSM parameter lookup failure

## v24.36.0

- Adjust AWS (SSM) lookup plugin to log an error and use "UNKNOWN" for the value of failed secrets, instead of raising exception and breaking all jobs within environment

## v24.29.0

- Add workaround for botocore issue with socket options for Lambda

## v24.28.1

- Fix error in JSON schema for Lambda protocol

## v24.28.0

- Update Lambda protocol to allow overriding default `read_timeoutÂ¦ value from 60 seconds. This is needed when executing long running Lambda functions

## v24.25.2

- Allow blank postCopyAction, or "none". This can be useful when using the same job definition for multiple environments and are using a variable to control the PCA. This way you can set the variable to "none" in the environment where you don't want it to run.
- Also prevent S3 source directories from starting or ending with a /

## v24.25.1

- Add possibility for encryption to the s3 schemas

## v24.25.0

- Added new cacheable plugin equivalent to the SSM one, but for Secrets Manager

## v24.23.0

- Added new cacheable plugin to allow dynamically updated variables to be written back to SSM Parameter Store. For more detail see `open-task-framework` documentation for version 24.22.0
- Minor tweaks to SSM lookup plugin

## v24.19.0

- Removed a stray `break` in S3 file listing that was preventing fetching more than the first 1000 records
- Added new feature to allow moving a file from the source S3 bucket into another destination as a post copy action by referencing the full `s3://` path.

## v24.16.0

- Added a wider window for refreshing token. If it's within 60 seconds of expiry when checking we will refresh it, so handle instances where there's a delay renewing.

## v24.15.0

- Fix issue where too many files were being uploaded from worker
- Properly fix STS token refresh code
- Linting updates for ruff
- Added unused argument linting check back in, which would have caught point 1
- Refactor redundant code relating to sessions and STS token refreshing, making the code more generic and moving to `creds.py` instea

## v24.14.2

- `black` formatting fix

## v24.14.1

- Add test coverage for s3 file renames when using proxy transfer type

## v24.14.0

- Add destination file rename to S3 transfers

## v24.13.0

- Fix temporary token not refreshing correctly
- Implement required breaking changes from `opentaskpy` v24.13.1

## v24.10.1

- More logging updates to handle major logging change in `opentaskpy` v24.10.0

## v24.10.0

- Fix logging for S3 not printing correct destination directory name

## v24.9.1

- Improve logging for S3 transfers so as to not need DEBUG set to see anything useful

## v24.9.0

- Fix exceptions thrown my S3 commands etc not causing transfer to fail
- Update lambda and ECS invocations to handle assume role correctly
- Update all AssumeRole usage to also check the expiry of the temporary token and renew them if necessary

## v24.8.0

- Handle paramstore responses with newlines better

## v24.5.1

- Ensure that S3 listing only matches the file we want, and not ones in lower directory trees

## v24.5.0

- Bump version of opentaskpy required
- Alter logging for found files to only print ones that match regex
- Fixes tests that correctly started failing after upgrading opentaskpy version
- Additional checking to PCAs to validate that it has actually happened

## v24.4.1

- Change version numbering format
- Allow forcing S3 transfers to proxy rather than using CopyObject. This prevents permission issues when trying to do cross account transfers where also using AssumeRole.

## v0.7.1

- Ensure AssumeRole gets run and creds created correctly

## v0.7.0

- Add ability to use AssumeRole in protocol definition

## v0.6.1

- Increase timeout for lambda function creation test
- Add missing schema for S3 transfer - PostCopyAction

## v0.6.0

- Add ability to trigger Fargate tasks
- Fix minor typo in schemas to use the correct paths in `$id`

## v0.5.3

- Bump required version of `opentaskpy` to v0.13.0

## v0.5.2

- Add code coverage checks to GitHub workflow
- Fix missing coverage in tests, and related bugs in code

## v0.5.1

- Update JSON source schemas for S3 transfers.
- Add badges to `README.md`
- Add code coverage checks to GitHub workflow

## v0.5.0

- Updated linting and workflows to match `opentaskpy` repo standards
- Updated to work with latest `opentaskpy` version
- Fix lots of tests. It seems tests only work when run from an actual machine, and no longer inside a dev container. It seems localstack cannot run lambda functions nested within 2 levels of docker container.

## v0.4.0

- Added proper JSON validation & add new tests to match
- Altered GitHub workflow to validate existence of `CHANGELOG.md` for each PR
- Update requirements for `opentaskpy` to `0.6.1`

## v0.3.0

- Added execution handler to call Lambda functions - This allows multiple invocation types, either async or synchronous. Be aware that synchronous execution will block until it's completed. When being used with a batch, the batch cannot kill the running lambda function if it times out before the function is completed.
